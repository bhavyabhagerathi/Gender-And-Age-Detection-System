# Gender-And-Age-Detection-System
### What does this system do?
Age and gender detection are the determination of the age and gender of the people in an image or video. This process allows essential data to be obtained and used very effectively in business development processes.
### Steps followed for age and gender detection:
* Import necessary modules
* Load the dataset
* Data analysis and exploration
* Feature Extraction
* CNN architecture design
* Visualization and interpretation
* Prediction using test data
### Uses of gender and age prediction :
* Understand what products and services different customer groups want and can afford.
* Target marketing campaigns more precisely and thus reduce the cost per lead or sale.
* Identify how society is changing and how they need to adapt.
